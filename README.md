A study guide for course pre-work

# <Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

The prework study guide webpage shows the four topics that were studied in this project including HTML, CSS, GIT and JavaScript.  We were able to build the structure of the site using HTML, then add characteristics to the site using CSS and lastly added a way for the user to interact with the site using JavaScript. 

One of my main problems/ questions is why I keep having problems updating the Github branches from my terminal.
